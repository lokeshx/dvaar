Specifically, the focus is on the synthesis and characterization of the adsorbents and metal catalysts for the removal of common atmospheric air pollutants such as CO2, NOx, and SOx by adsorption and/or catalytic oxidation and that of solutes like arsenic, fluoride, heavy metals, and organics from wastewater by adsorption. We have also undertaken studies on the development of carbon molecular sieves for the sequestration of CO2. We have carried out experimental studies on the development of novel liquid-solid contactors to remove dissolved solutes from wastewater. On the theoretical side, a number of mathematical models based on lattice Boltzmann method have been developed to predict the breakthrough curves in the narrow tubular packed bed adsorber.

We have been working on (i) Structure and dynamics of hydrogen bonds and their relations to vibrational spectral diffusion in associated liquids, (ii) Molecular and collective dynamics and dielectric decrement of electrolyte solutions at high ion concentrations, (iii) Structure, dynamics and polarity of molecular liquids at solid-liquid and liquid-vapour interfaces and in confined environment, (iv) Behaviour of molecular solutions under extreme conditions,(v) Hydration and translocation of protonic defects in aqueous systems and (vi) Electron localization in molecular liquids and clusters. Our work includes both development of theories based on modern statistical mechanical methods as well as applications of state-of-the-art simulation techniques.       Studies of hydrogen bond dynamics in associated liquids constitute a major area of our research in recent years. We showed how the presence of ions affects the structure and dynamics of hydrogen bonds in aqueous systems. Very recently, we have gone beyond the use of pair potentials and has used the technique of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics to study the relaxation of hydrogen bonds and associated vibrational spectral diffusion in aqueous and other associated liquids from first principles without using any pair potentials. We have established the connections of observed spectral diffusion to underlying molecular dynamics of water molecules from first principles calculations.",Department of Chemistry,Theoretical physical chemistry,,,,,http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/amalendu-chandra,IIT Kanpur,http://iitk.ac.in/new/images/faculty-images/Chemistry/amalendu-chandra.jpg,,,
